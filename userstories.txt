AS A USER, I want to:
- [ ] create a project and be able to change the name of that project
- [ ] create multiple boards and name/rename each board
- [ ] create multiple tasks in each board
- [ ] rearrange task order in the board
- [ ] move tasks from one board to another
- [ ] rearrange board order in the project


SPRINT 1:
MVP = task list/todo app
- create a task by typing in a text box and hitting the enter key or a submit button
- submission of the first task renders two boards, "to do" and "complete"
- submitting tasks adds the text to an unordered list "to do" shown on the page
- display tasks in a list in descending order (oldest on top, newest on bottom)
- clicking on a task takes displays a modal where you can edit the text or mark the task as complete
- when a task is marked complete it is removed from the "to do" board and put in the "complete" board


SPRINT 2:
MVP = todo app with drag and drop
- reorder the tasks vertically within the board by dragging and dropping
- when a task is dropped in the "complete" board it is automatically marked complete; removing a task from "complete" automatically reverses it's completion status


SPRINT 3:
MVP = kaban board
- create a board by opening menu and clicking "new board"
- name and rename boards by clicking "edit board" button that is at the top of each board; opens a modal that lets you rename or delete the board
- reorder boards horizontally on the page by dragging and dropping
- when a board is deleted display a modal asking if you want the tasks to be moved to "complete" or want them deleted


ICEBOX:
- create multiple projects, each with multiple boards
